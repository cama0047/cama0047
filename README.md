# Current project
## Rental Management Solution
The rental management platform has been used by multiple equipment rental companies to manage equipment, leases, customers, orders, payments, and hardware keys that can be used to unlock, start and stop heavy duty equipment in the fields with or without Internet connections. The solution supports a super admin dashboard, an admin dashboard (for equipment owner company), and iOS/Android mobile apps for final users. The mobile app users can use their apps to unlock, start, and stop the equipment in the fields with a valid key from the backend from an ongoing lease of the corresponding equipment. Sophisticated RBAC (role-based-access-control) was designed and included in the system to support different types of roles for different equipment owners. A custom theme is supported for different equipment owner on the dashboard and mobile apps. The backend is based on Node.JS in TypeScript, and the frontend is based on React.JS in TypeScript. Mobile apps are developed using Swift & Kotlin. 
Team size: 5-10

# Past proyects
## OntarioOneCall Application for excavators and Admins

The project encompassed the creation of two applications tailored for Excavators and Administrators, aiming to optimize the excavation permit request and notification process through the utilization of Ontario OneCall services. The project was developed using TypeScript and JavaScript. Both applications were designed with a focus on robustness and scalability. The implementation of RESTful APIs facilitated seamless communication between frontend and backend systems, enabling efficient data exchange and interaction. Also, a significant contribution was the development of Application-to-Person (A2P) notifications. Leveraging the Simple Notification Service (SNS), the system was configured to send notifications to relevant individuals, such as excavators or administrators, regarding permit status updates, approvals, or any other pertinent information.

  ## Scrap Art Music App
  Project developed for an artistic company, tasked with transforming recycled objects into musical instruments. The project embraced an architecture centered around serverless functions using Lambdas. Efficient infrastructure management was achieved using AWS cloud services, leveraging resources such as Amazon EC2 for specific Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cases and S3 for cloud storage. Additionally, TypeScript was applied to ensure the robustness of development, Tailwind CSS was utilized as a framework for rapid development, and the database was efficiently managed to support data integrity in the project along with Python web scrapping.
